#-----HOW TO CHECK OUT LOCALLY-----
#If you'd like to try the app out locally on your machine, download the project.
#Next, you will need to have npm, which is a package manager. It can be installed at https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
#After you have it installed, open the Node.js command prompt that comes with the install.
#Cd to the path of the folder where you installed the project.
#Cd to either front-end or back-end.
#Run 'npm install' without the single quotes to download the dependencies.
#Do the same for the other *-end folder.
#Cd to the back-end folder and run 'npm start' without hte single quotes.
#Next, open another Node.js prompt and Cd to the front-end folder.
#Run 'npm start' without the single quotes. After a couple of minutes, you should be prompted with a Yes or No question. Type 'Y' without
#the single quotes and hit Enter.
#Open a browser, preferrably Google Chrome, and go to 'http://localhost:3001'. You are now running a (cosmetic version of a) 
#face recognition website locally on your machine!
#Register a new user and provide a web link to an image. The site will then draw a box around the object that most likely resembles
#a face.
